# YouTube Shorts to Standard Player Converter
## What is this?
This is a script meant to replace shorts (`/shorts`) Youtube URLs with standard ones (`/watch?v=ID`). It's basically my re-purposed [Youtube timestamps remover](https://github.com/RedSQL/personal-scripts-and-misc/tree/master/userscripts/Youtube%20URL%20Timestamp%20Remover).

## Why?
Because, in my humble opinion, Youtube Shorts player is abysmal. Namely, it does not have forward/backwards skipping and is basically a ripoff of a player from their competitors. Not sure why they ripped off even the... not so great part of it, but sure.
