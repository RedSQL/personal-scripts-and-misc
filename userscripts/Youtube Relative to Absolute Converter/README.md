# YouTube Relative to Absolute Timestamp Converter
### [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedSQL/personal-scripts-and-misc/master/userscripts/Youtube%20Relative%20to%20Absolute%20Converter/relativeToAbsolute.user.js)
## What is this?
This is a relative (e.g 1 minute ago, 2 hours ago, 3 days ago...) to absolute (e.g October 1st 2022, February 15 2013...) time converter for Youtube videos. It replaces the relative time that is in the unexpanded description with the absolute time that you would see on hover or by expanding the description box under the video. 

## Why?
Even though there is still an absolute timestamp in the video description, it only appears if you hover on the timestamp or expand the description box. While some people may like it that way, some may find it annoying that they have to hover/expand on the description box just to get the date of when the video was released.
