# Installing UserStyles
## Option A (Recommended) - Using Stylus for UserStyle
1. Install [Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). (Available for Chromium based browsers and Firefox)
2. Find a folder with UserStyle you want to have.
3. In that folder, click on the file that ends with **user.css**. (e.g "UserStyleByAuthor.user.css")
4. Click on the "Raw" button on the top right of the code container.
5. Agree to install the UserStyle when prompted.

If you weren't prompted with installation when you clicked "Raw", then you either have not installed Stylus extension correctly, or your installation is broken.

If you have **not** unchecked "Check for updates" checkbox, UserStyle should automatically update as I change it.

## Option B - Using Grease/Tamper/Violentmonkey for UserScript.

1. Install either:
	- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Recommended)
	- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
	- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (**Not recommended**. I heavily discourage you from using it.)
2. Find a folder with UserStyle you want to have.
3. In that folder, click on the file that ends with **user.js**. (e.g "UserStyleByAuthor.user.js")
4. Click on the "Raw" button on the top right of the code container.
5. Agree to install the UserScript when prompted.

I *do not really* recommend this method, as userscripts are on limited support from me. I tried making them auto-update CSS when I update the userstyle itself, but not sure if it will work for everyone. In any case, I tried, but don't expect full support on them.
