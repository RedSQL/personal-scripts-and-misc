# About Userstyles
All userstyles here are created for [Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). I **do not guarantee** that it will work on all browsers, platforms or even for everyone. It seems to work on Firefox and Chromium-based browsers. 

# Contributing
I am not a designer, nor a very good coder. If you want to, you can improve my code here. Just open a PR with the fix or at least an issue describing what I can fix and how.
