! Remove basic interactions - Such things include Likes/Dislikes, Sharing, Playlist saving and Reporting! All those could be used to *harass* the creator! Getting rid of them will bring content creators nothing but joy and peace from being bullied!

! Remove comment section - Team already tried removing dislikes from comments but the comments have not improved in their quality! Seems like comments, as an idea, is a failure. Let's remove it!

! Remove view count - You could potentially see that a video may not be doing well! That's not good for content creator's well being! Let's get rid of that too!

! Remove sub count - Are we seriously gonna let people to see how much subscribers a youtuber has?? Team already tried rectifying this with simplifying sub numbers but let's get rid of it altogether! This is for everyone's sake!

! Remove video description - Content creator could possibly inform their audience that they might be receiving a lot of negative feedback!.... Err... On some other site? In any case, creator communication is another source of negativity and let's cut it!

! Remove recommended section - Even though Team tries its best to not recommend people a contradictory type of content on something, let's be safe and remove this recommendation thing altogether!
